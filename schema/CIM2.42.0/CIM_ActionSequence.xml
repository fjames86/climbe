The Action classes participating in this association must have the same value for the Action.Direction property - since they are either part of a sequence to transition a SoftwareElement into its next state or to uninstall it. The next-state and uninstall Actions associated with a particular SoftwareElement must be a continuous sequence. 
ActionSequence is an association that loops on the Action classes with roles for the &apos;prior&apos; and &apos;next&apos; Actions in the sequence. The need for a continuous sequence imples: (1)Within the set of next-state or uninstall Actions, there is one and only one Action that does not have an instance of ActionSequence referencing it in the &apos;next&apos; role. This is the first Action in the sequence. (2) Within the set of next-state or uninstall Actions, there is one and only one Action that does not have an instance of ActionSequence referencing it in the &apos;prior&apos; role. This is the last Action in the sequence. (3) All other Actions within the set of next-state and uninstall Actions must participate in two instances of ActionSequence, one in a &apos;prior&apos; role and the other in the &apos;next&apos; role.</VALUE></QUALIFIER><PROPERTY.REFERENCE CLASSORIGIN="CIM_ActionSequence" PROPAGATED="false" REFERENCECLASS="CIM_Action" NAME="Next"><QUALIFIER OVERRIDABLE="false" NAME="Key" TYPE="boolean"><VALUE>true</VALUE></QUALIFIER><QUALIFIER NAME="Max" TYPE="uint32"><VALUE>1</VALUE></QUALIFIER><QUALIFIER TRANSLATABLE="true" NAME="Description" TYPE="string"><VALUE>The next Action in the sequence.</VALUE></QUALIFIER></PROPERTY.REFERENCE><PROPERTY.REFERENCE CLASSORIGIN="CIM_ActionSequence" PROPAGATED="false" REFERENCECLASS="CIM_Action" NAME="Prior"><QUALIFIER OVERRIDABLE="false" NAME="Key" TYPE="boolean"><VALUE>true</VALUE></QUALIFIER><QUALIFIER NAME="Max" TYPE="uint32"><VALUE>1</VALUE></QUALIFIER><QUALIFIER TRANSLATABLE="true" NAME="Description" TYPE="string"><VALUE>The previous Action in the sequence.</VALUE></QUALIFIER></PROPERTY.REFERENCE></CLASS></VALUE.OBJECT></DECLGROUP></DECLARATION></CIM>
