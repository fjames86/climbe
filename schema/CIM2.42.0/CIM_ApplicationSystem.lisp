                  "Distribution describes how the application system is distributed with respect to its underlying servers. In general, the application system is distributed or local. This property indicates whether the application system is running on one or multiple servers. This can be determined without having to query for associated servers represented by ComputerSystems. Distributed systems also introduce a virtual notion to themselves. Note that a distributed application system is not tangible but virtual. Only its contained local systems can be found as processes or threads, and can therefore be regarded as tangible. The distributed system remains a named, virtual entity, that scopes strongly bound constituents and allows the application to be managed in its entirety. 
The property is needed to help root cause analysis and operations, especially when these are automated, in order to clearly know that more than one executed application - most likely the local application systems - is affected by the management task. This is particularly true if the contained application systems provide uniform functionality like webserver or application server farms. 
To express constraints between distributed and local system, this class must be derived and appropriate associations must be defined. 
This property should not be confused with the Roles[] property defined in System. The latter is reserved for administrator assigned roles.")

It reflects the notion of an execution status tailored to applications and represents a summary of the original property.

The actual state of the element is represented by EnabledState. This property is provided to compare the last requested and current enabled or disabled states. Note that when EnabledState is set to 5 (\"Not Applicable\"), then this property has no meaning. Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. 
\"Unknown\" (0) indicates the last requested state for the element is unknown.
Note that the value \"No Change\" (5) has been deprecated in lieu of indicating the last requested state is \"Unknown\" (0). If the last requested or desired state is unknown, RequestedState should have the value \"Unknown\" (0), but may have the value \"No Change\" (5).Offline (6) indicates that the element has been requested to transition to the Enabled but Offline EnabledState. 
It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are \"Reboot\" (10) and \"Reset\" (11). Reboot refers to doing a \"Shut Down\" and then moving to an \"Enabled\" state. Reset indicates that the element is first \"Disabled\" and then \"Enabled\". The distinction between requesting \"Shut Down\" and \"Disabled\" should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. 

This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. 

If knowledge of the last RequestedState is not supported for the EnabledLogicalElement, the property shall be NULL or have the value 12 \"Not Applicable\".")

1) Status is more correctly defined as an array. This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 
2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 
3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code.

Various subclasses of this class may override this property to make it required, or a key. Such subclasses may also modify the preferred algorithms for ensuring uniqueness that are defined below.
To ensure uniqueness within the NameSpace, the value of InstanceID should be constructed using the following \"preferred\" algorithm: 
<OrgID>:<LocalID> 
Where <OrgID> and <LocalID> are separated by a colon (:), and where <OrgID> must include a copyrighted, trademarked, or otherwise unique name that is owned by the business entity that is creating or defining the InstanceID or that is a registered ID assigned to the business entity by a recognized global authority. (This requirement is similar to the <Schema Name>_<Class Name> structure of Schema class names.) In addition, to ensure uniqueness, <OrgID> must not contain a colon (:). When using this algorithm, the first colon to appear in InstanceID must appear between <OrgID> and <LocalID>. 
<LocalID> is chosen by the business entity and should not be reused to identify different underlying (real-world) elements. If not null and the above \"preferred\" algorithm is not used, the defining entity must assure that the resulting InstanceID is not reused across any InstanceIDs produced by this or other providers for the NameSpace of this instance.

\"Stressed\" indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of \"Stressed\" states are overload, overheated, and so on. 
\"Predictive Failure\" indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 
\"In Service\" describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 
\"No Contact\" indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 
\"Lost Communication\" indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 
\"Stopped\" and \"Aborted\" are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 
\"Dormant\" indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 
\"Supporting Entity in Error\" indicates that this element might be \"OK\" but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 
\"Completed\" indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 
\"Power Mode\" indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. 
\"Relocating\" indicates the element is being relocated.
OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element.

The Features for a particular application or software system are located using the CIM_ApplicationSystemSoftwareFeature association. The features are part of the deployment-oriented aspects of the application system. 
With regard to the application runtime aspects, the ApplicationSystem class also represents the core class of the Application Systems' sub-model which of the application runtime model. Its role in the systems sub-model is a) the root node of the containment hierarchy of the application elements (at runtime) as services, components, sub-systems, etc., b) the place for runtime overview information such as response time or system status, c) runtime control of the entire application (e.g., start/stop), and d) the main entry point to the navigation through and drill-down into the runtime model. 
The lifetime of an instance of this class is not limited to the application instance it represents. Even if the application is not running, the ApplicationSystem object can report properties that have values (e.g., the name of the application or the current status). Note that it is also possible to define the lifetime of the objects through the lifetime of the application instances.
