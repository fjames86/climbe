This property is similar to a key value in that it can be used for identification, when correlating Indications (see the CorrelatedIndications array). Its value SHOULD be unique as long as correlations are reported, but MAY be reused or left NULL if no future Indications will reference it in their CorrelatedIndications array.To ensure uniqueness, the value of IndicationIdentifier should be constructed using the following &quot;preferred&quot; algorithm: 
&lt;OrgID&gt;:&lt;LocalID&gt; 
Where &lt;OrgID&gt; and &lt;LocalID&gt; are separated by a colon (:), and where &lt;OrgID&gt; must include a copyrighted, trademarked, or otherwise unique name that is owned by the business entity that is creating or defining the IndicationIdentifier or that is a recognized ID that is assigned to the business entity by a recognized global authority. (This requirement is similar to the &lt;Schema Name&gt;_&lt;Class Name&gt; structure of Schema class names.) In addition, to ensure uniqueness &lt;OrgID&gt; must not contain a colon (:). When using this algorithm, the first colon to appear in IndicationIdentifier must appear between &lt;OrgID&gt; and &lt;LocalID&gt;. 
&lt;LocalID&gt; is chosen by the business entity and should not be re-used to identify different underlying (real-world) elements. 
If the above &quot;preferred&quot; algorithm is not used, the defining entity should assure that the resulting IndicationIdentifier is not re-used across any IndicationIdentifiers that are produced by this or other providers for the NameSpace of this instance. 
For DMTF-defined instances, the &quot;preferred&quot; algorithm should be used with the &lt;OrgID&gt; set to CIM.</VALUE></QUALIFIER><QUALIFIER NAME="MappingStrings" TYPE="string"><VALUE.ARRAY><VALUE>Recommendation.ITU|X733.Notification identifier</VALUE></VALUE.ARRAY></QUALIFIER></PROPERTY><PROPERTY.ARRAY CLASSORIGIN="CIM_Indication" PROPAGATED="true" NAME="CorrelatedIndications" TYPE="string"><QUALIFIER TRANSLATABLE="true" NAME="Description" TYPE="string"><VALUE>A list of IndicationIdentifiers whose notifications are correlated with (related to) this one.</VALUE></QUALIFIER><QUALIFIER NAME="MappingStrings" TYPE="string"><VALUE.ARRAY><VALUE>Recommendation.ITU|X733.Correlated notifications</VALUE></VALUE.ARRAY></QUALIFIER><QUALIFIER NAME="ModelCorrespondence" TYPE="string"><VALUE.ARRAY><VALUE>CIM_Indication.IndicationIdentifier</VALUE></VALUE.ARRAY></QUALIFIER></PROPERTY.ARRAY><PROPERTY CLASSORIGIN="CIM_Indication" PROPAGATED="true" NAME="IndicationTime" TYPE="datetime"><QUALIFIER TRANSLATABLE="true" NAME="Description" TYPE="string"><VALUE>The time and date of creation of the Indication.

7 - Fatal/NonRecoverable should be used to indicate an error occurred, but it&apos;s too late to take remedial action. 
2 and 0 - Information and Unknown (respectively) follow common usage.

The sequence number portion of the sequence identifier is provided by the SequenceNumber property. The combination of both property values represents the sequence identifier for the indication.
The sequence identifier for the indication enables a CIM listener to identify duplicate indications when the CIM service attempts the delivery retry of indications, to reorder indications that arrive out-of-order, and to detect lost indications.
If a CIM service does not support sequence identifiers for indications, this property shall be NULL.
If a CIM service supports sequence identifiers for indications, this property shall be maintained by the CIM service for each registered listener destination, and its value shall uniquely identify the CIM service and the indication service within the CIM service such that restarts of the CIM service and deregistration of listener destinations to the CIM service cause the value to change, without reusing earlier values for a sufficiently long time.
When retrying the delivery of an indication, this property shall have the same value as in the original delivery.
To guarantee this uniqueness, the property value should be constructed using the following format (defined in ABNF): sequence-context = indication-service-name &quot;#&quot; cim-service-start-id &quot;#&quot; listener-destination-creation-time
Where: indication-service-name is the value of the Name property of the CIM_IndicationService instance responsible for delivering the indication. cim-service-start-id is an identifier that uniquely identifies the CIM service start, for example via a timestamp of the start time, or via a counter that increases for each start or restart. listener-destination-creation-time is a timestamp of the creation time of the CIM_ListenerDestination instance representing the listener destination.
Since this format is only a recommendation, CIM clients shall treat the value as an opaque identifier for the sequence context and shall not rely on this format.</VALUE></QUALIFIER><QUALIFIER NAME="ModelCorrespondence" TYPE="string"><VALUE.ARRAY><VALUE>CIM_Indication.SequenceNumber</VALUE></VALUE.ARRAY></QUALIFIER></PROPERTY><PROPERTY CLASSORIGIN="CIM_Indication" PROPAGATED="true" NAME="SequenceNumber" TYPE="sint64"><QUALIFIER TRANSLATABLE="true" NAME="Description" TYPE="string"><VALUE>The sequence number portion of a sequence identifier for the indication.
