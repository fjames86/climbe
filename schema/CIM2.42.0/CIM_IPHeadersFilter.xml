Various operational statuses are defined. Many of the enumeration&apos;s values are self-explanatory. However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 
&quot;Stressed&quot; indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of &quot;Stressed&quot; states are overload, overheated, and so on. 
&quot;Predictive Failure&quot; indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 
&quot;In Service&quot; describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 
&quot;No Contact&quot; indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 
&quot;Lost Communication&quot; indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 
&quot;Stopped&quot; and &quot;Aborted&quot; are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 
&quot;Dormant&quot; indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 
&quot;Supporting Entity in Error&quot; indicates that this element might be &quot;OK&quot; but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 
&quot;Completed&quot; indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 
&quot;Power Mode&quot; indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. 
&quot;Relocating&quot; indicates the element is being relocated.
OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today&apos;s environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element.</VALUE></QUALIFIER><QUALIFIER NAME="ValueMap" TYPE="string"><VALUE.ARRAY><VALUE>0</VALUE><VALUE>1</VALUE><VALUE>2</VALUE><VALUE>3</VALUE><VALUE>4</VALUE><VALUE>5</VALUE><VALUE>6</VALUE><VALUE>7</VALUE><VALUE>8</VALUE><VALUE>9</VALUE><VALUE>10</VALUE><VALUE>11</VALUE><VALUE>12</VALUE><VALUE>13</VALUE><VALUE>14</VALUE><VALUE>15</VALUE><VALUE>16</VALUE><VALUE>17</VALUE><VALUE>18</VALUE><VALUE>19</VALUE><VALUE>..</VALUE><VALUE>0x8000..</VALUE></VALUE.ARRAY></QUALIFIER><QUALIFIER TRANSLATABLE="true" NAME="Values" TYPE="string"><VALUE.ARRAY><VALUE>Unknown</VALUE><VALUE>Other</VALUE><VALUE>OK</VALUE><VALUE>Degraded</VALUE><VALUE>Stressed</VALUE><VALUE>Predictive Failure</VALUE><VALUE>Error</VALUE><VALUE>Non-Recoverable Error</VALUE><VALUE>Starting</VALUE><VALUE>Stopping</VALUE><VALUE>Stopped</VALUE><VALUE>In Service</VALUE><VALUE>No Contact</VALUE><VALUE>Lost Communication</VALUE><VALUE>Aborted</VALUE><VALUE>Dormant</VALUE><VALUE>Supporting Entity in Error</VALUE><VALUE>Completed</VALUE><VALUE>Power Mode</VALUE><VALUE>Relocating</VALUE><VALUE>DMTF Reserved</VALUE><VALUE>Vendor Reserved</VALUE></VALUE.ARRAY></QUALIFIER><QUALIFIER OVERRIDABLE="false" NAME="ArrayType" TYPE="string"><VALUE>Indexed</VALUE></QUALIFIER><QUALIFIER NAME="ModelCorrespondence" TYPE="string"><VALUE.ARRAY><VALUE>CIM_ManagedSystemElement.StatusDescriptions</VALUE></VALUE.ARRAY></QUALIFIER></PROPERTY.ARRAY><PROPERTY.ARRAY CLASSORIGIN="CIM_ManagedSystemElement" PROPAGATED="true" NAME="StatusDescriptions" TYPE="string"><QUALIFIER TRANSLATABLE="true" NAME="Description" TYPE="string"><VALUE>Strings describing the various OperationalStatus array values.

1) Status is more correctly defined as an array. This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 
2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 
3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code. Therefore, Status was grandfathered into the Schema.

&quot;Starting&quot; describes an element being initialized. 
&quot;Stopping&quot; describes an element being brought to an orderly stop. 
&quot;Stopped&quot; and &quot;Aborted&quot; are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 
&quot;Dormant&quot; indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 
&quot;Completed&quot; indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded in the PrimaryStatus so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 
&quot;Migrating&quot; element is being moved between host elements. 
&quot;Immigrating&quot; element is being moved to new host element. 
&quot;Emigrating&quot; element is being moved away from host element. 
&quot;Shutting Down&quot; describes an element being brought to an abrupt stop. 
&quot;In Test&quot; element is performing test functions. 
&quot;Transitioning&quot; describes an element that is between states, that is, it is not fully available in either its previous state or its next state. This value should be used if other values indicating a transition to a specific state are not applicable.
&quot;In Service&quot; describes an element that is in service and operational.</VALUE></QUALIFIER><QUALIFIER NAME="ValueMap" TYPE="string"><VALUE.ARRAY><VALUE>0</VALUE><VALUE>1</VALUE><VALUE>2</VALUE><VALUE>3</VALUE><VALUE>4</VALUE><VALUE>5</VALUE><VALUE>6</VALUE><VALUE>7</VALUE><VALUE>8</VALUE><VALUE>9</VALUE><VALUE>10</VALUE><VALUE>11</VALUE><VALUE>12</VALUE><VALUE>13</VALUE><VALUE>14</VALUE><VALUE>15</VALUE><VALUE>16</VALUE><VALUE>..</VALUE><VALUE>0x8000..</VALUE></VALUE.ARRAY></QUALIFIER><QUALIFIER TRANSLATABLE="true" NAME="Values" TYPE="string"><VALUE.ARRAY><VALUE>Unknown</VALUE><VALUE>Not Available</VALUE><VALUE>Servicing</VALUE><VALUE>Starting</VALUE><VALUE>Stopping</VALUE><VALUE>Stopped</VALUE><VALUE>Aborted</VALUE><VALUE>Dormant</VALUE><VALUE>Completed</VALUE><VALUE>Migrating</VALUE><VALUE>Emigrating</VALUE><VALUE>Immigrating</VALUE><VALUE>Snapshotting</VALUE><VALUE>Shutting Down</VALUE><VALUE>In Test</VALUE><VALUE>Transitioning</VALUE><VALUE>In Service</VALUE><VALUE>DMTF Reserved</VALUE><VALUE>Vendor Reserved</VALUE></VALUE.ARRAY></QUALIFIER><QUALIFIER NAME="ModelCorrespondence" TYPE="string"><VALUE.ARRAY><VALUE>CIM_EnabledLogicalElement.EnabledState</VALUE></VALUE.ARRAY></QUALIFIER></PROPERTY><PROPERTY CLASSORIGIN="CIM_ManagedSystemElement" PROPAGATED="true" NAME="PrimaryStatus" TYPE="uint16"><QUALIFIER TRANSLATABLE="true" NAME="Description" TYPE="string"><VALUE>PrimaryStatus provides a high level status value, intended to align with Red-Yellow-Green type representation of status.

Various subclasses of this class may override this property to make it required, or a key. Such subclasses may also modify the preferred algorithms for ensuring uniqueness that are defined below.
To ensure uniqueness within the NameSpace, the value of InstanceID should be constructed using the following &quot;preferred&quot; algorithm: 
&lt;OrgID&gt;:&lt;LocalID&gt; 
Where &lt;OrgID&gt; and &lt;LocalID&gt; are separated by a colon (:), and where &lt;OrgID&gt; must include a copyrighted, trademarked, or otherwise unique name that is owned by the business entity that is creating or defining the InstanceID or that is a registered ID assigned to the business entity by a recognized global authority. (This requirement is similar to the &lt;Schema Name&gt;_&lt;Class Name&gt; structure of Schema class names.) In addition, to ensure uniqueness, &lt;OrgID&gt; must not contain a colon (:). When using this algorithm, the first colon to appear in InstanceID must appear between &lt;OrgID&gt; and &lt;LocalID&gt;. 
&lt;LocalID&gt; is chosen by the business entity and should not be reused to identify different underlying (real-world) elements. If not null and the above &quot;preferred&quot; algorithm is not used, the defining entity must assure that the resulting InstanceID is not reused across any InstanceIDs produced by this or other providers for the NameSpace of this instance. 
If not set to null for DMTF-defined instances, the &quot;preferred&quot; algorithm must be used with the &lt;OrgID&gt; set to CIM.</VALUE></QUALIFIER></PROPERTY><PROPERTY CLASSORIGIN="CIM_ManagedElement" PROPAGATED="true" NAME="Caption" TYPE="string"><QUALIFIER TRANSLATABLE="true" NAME="Description" TYPE="string"><VALUE>The Caption property is a short textual description (one- line string) of the object.</VALUE></QUALIFIER><QUALIFIER NAME="MaxLen" TYPE="uint32"><VALUE>64</VALUE></QUALIFIER></PROPERTY><PROPERTY CLASSORIGIN="CIM_ManagedElement" PROPAGATED="true" NAME="Description" TYPE="string"><QUALIFIER TRANSLATABLE="true" NAME="Description" TYPE="string"><VALUE>The Description property provides a textual description of the object.</VALUE></QUALIFIER></PROPERTY><PROPERTY CLASSORIGIN="CIM_ManagedElement" PROPAGATED="true" NAME="ElementName" TYPE="string"><QUALIFIER TRANSLATABLE="true" NAME="Description" TYPE="string"><VALUE>A user-friendly name for the object.

Note that the Name property of ManagedSystemElement is also defined as a user-friendly name. But, it is often subclassed to be a Key. It is not reasonable that the same property can convey both identity and a user-friendly name, without inconsistencies. Where Name exists and is not a Key (such as for instances of LogicalDevice), the same information can be present in both the Name and ElementName properties.
