Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. 
\"Unknown\" (0) indicates the last requested state for the element is unknown.
Note that the value \"No Change\" (5) has been deprecated in lieu of indicating the last requested state is \"Unknown\" (0). If the last requested or desired state is unknown, RequestedState should have the value \"Unknown\" (0), but may have the value \"No Change\" (5).Offline (6) indicates that the element has been requested to transition to the Enabled but Offline EnabledState. 
It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are \"Reboot\" (10) and \"Reset\" (11). Reboot refers to doing a \"Shut Down\" and then moving to an \"Enabled\" state. Reset indicates that the element is first \"Disabled\" and then \"Enabled\". The distinction between requesting \"Shut Down\" and \"Disabled\" should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. 

This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. 

If knowledge of the last RequestedState is not supported for the EnabledLogicalElement, the property shall be NULL or have the value 12 \"Not Applicable\".")

1) Status is more correctly defined as an array. This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 
2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values.

When using this algorithm, the first colon to appear in InstanceID must appear between <OrgID> and <LocalID>. 
<LocalID> is chosen by the business entity and should not be reused to identify different underlying (real-world) elements. If not null and the above \"preferred\" algorithm is not used, the defining entity must assure that the resulting InstanceID is not reused across any InstanceIDs produced by this or other providers for the NameSpace of this instance.
