This allows it to be matched against the values extracted from the ID payload at runtime. 

Note that a wildcard mechanism may be used when MatchIdentityType specifies a general character string (for example, if MatchIdentityType=3, 'FQDN'). MatchFieldValue may contain a wildcard character, '*', in the pattern match specification. For example, for 'FQDN', a MatchFieldValue of '*@example.com' will successfully match an ID payload of 'janedoe@example.com'. A wildcard can be used to represent 0 or more characters as is appropriate for the type specified in MatchIdentityType.")

1) Status is more correctly defined as an array. This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 
2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 
3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code.

When using this algorithm, the first colon to appear in InstanceID must appear between <OrgID> and <LocalID>. 
<LocalID> is chosen by the business entity and should not be reused to identify different underlying (real-world) elements. If not null and the above \"preferred\" algorithm is not used, the defining entity must assure that the resulting InstanceID is not reused across any InstanceIDs produced by this or other providers for the NameSpace of this instance.
