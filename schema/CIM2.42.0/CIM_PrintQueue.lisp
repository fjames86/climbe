The actual state of the element is represented by EnabledState. This property is provided to compare the last requested and current enabled or disabled states. Note that when EnabledState is set to 5 (\"Not Applicable\"), then this property has no meaning. Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. 
\"Unknown\" (0) indicates the last requested state for the element is unknown.
Note that the value \"No Change\" (5) has been deprecated in lieu of indicating the last requested state is \"Unknown\" (0). If the last requested or desired state is unknown, RequestedState should have the value \"Unknown\" (0), but may have the value \"No Change\" (5).Offline (6) indicates that the element has been requested to transition to the Enabled but Offline EnabledState. 
It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are \"Reboot\" (10) and \"Reset\" (11). Reboot refers to doing a \"Shut Down\" and then moving to an \"Enabled\" state. Reset indicates that the element is first \"Disabled\" and then \"Enabled\". The distinction between requesting \"Shut Down\" and \"Disabled\" should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. 

This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code.

2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 
3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code.

Various subclasses of this class may override this property to make it required, or a key. Such subclasses may also modify the preferred algorithms for ensuring uniqueness that are defined below.
To ensure uniqueness within the NameSpace, the value of InstanceID should be constructed using the following \"preferred\" algorithm: 
<OrgID>:<LocalID> 
Where <OrgID> and <LocalID> are separated by a colon (:), and where <OrgID> must include a copyrighted, trademarked, or otherwise unique name that is owned by the business entity that is creating or defining the InstanceID or that is a registered ID assigned to the business entity by a recognized global authority. (This requirement is similar to the <Schema Name>_<Class Name> structure of Schema class names.) In addition, to ensure uniqueness, <OrgID> must not contain a colon (:). When using this algorithm, the first colon to appear in InstanceID must appear between <OrgID> and <LocalID>. 
<LocalID> is chosen by the business entity and should not be reused to identify different underlying (real-world) elements. If not null and the above \"preferred\" algorithm is not used, the defining entity must assure that the resulting InstanceID is not reused across any InstanceIDs produced by this or other providers for the NameSpace of this instance.
