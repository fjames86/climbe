<OrgID>:<LocalID> 
Where <OrgID> and <LocalID> are separated by a colon (:), and where <OrgID> must include a copyrighted, trademarked, or otherwise unique name that is owned by the business entity that is creating or defining the InstanceID or that is a registered ID assigned to the business entity by a recognized global authority. (This requirement is similar to the <Schema Name>_<Class Name> structure of Schema class names.) In addition, to ensure uniqueness, <OrgID> must not contain a colon (:). When using this algorithm, the first colon to appear in InstanceID must appear between <OrgID> and <LocalID>. 
<LocalID> is chosen by the business entity and should not be reused to identify different underlying (real-world) elements. If the above \"preferred\" algorithm is not used, the defining entity must ensure that the resulting InstanceID is not reused across any InstanceIDs produced by this or other providers for the NameSpace of this instance. 
For DMTF-defined instances, the \"preferred\" algorithm must be used with the <OrgID> set to CIM."))

1) Status is more correctly defined as an array. This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped. 
2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values. 
3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code.

\"Stopped\" and \"Aborted\" are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 
\"Dormant\" indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 
\"Supporting Entity in Error\" indicates that this element might be \"OK\" but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 
\"Completed\" indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 
\"Power Mode\" indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. 
\"Relocating\" indicates the element is being relocated.
OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element.")

                "A ResourcePool is a logical entity (with associated controls)provided by the host system for the purpose of allocation and assignment of resources. A given ResourcePool may be used to allocate resources of a specific type. Hierarchies of ResourcePools may be created to provide administrative control over allocations. In the cases where resources are subdivided, multiple resource pools may exist (e.g. nodal boundaries in NUMA-like systems). In systems that support over commitment, pools represent the reservable capacity, not an upper bound or limit on the maximum amount that can be allocated. Admission control during power on may detect and prevent systems from powering due to resource exhaustion. For example, over commitment on a ResourcePool with ResourceType=Memory would require that sufficient space be available in some backing-store, that may be managed through a storage ResourcePool.")))
