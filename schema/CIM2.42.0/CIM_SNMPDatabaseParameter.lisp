                  "Within the scope of the instantiating Namespace, InstanceID opaquely and uniquely identifies an instance of this class. To ensure uniqueness within the NameSpace, the value of InstanceID should be constructed using the following \"preferred\" algorithm: 
<OrgID>:<LocalID> 
Where <OrgID> and <LocalID> are separated by a colon (:), and where <OrgID> must include a copyrighted, trademarked, or otherwise unique name that is owned by the business entity that is creating or defining the InstanceID or that is a registered ID assigned to the business entity by a recognized global authority. (This requirement is similar to the <Schema Name>_<Class Name> structure of Schema class names.) In addition, to ensure uniqueness, <OrgID> must not contain a colon (:). When using this algorithm, the first colon to appear in InstanceID must appear between <OrgID> and <LocalID>. 
<LocalID> is chosen by the business entity and should not be reused to identify different underlying (real-world) elements. If the above \"preferred\" algorithm is not used, the defining entity must assure that the resulting InstanceID is not reused across any InstanceIDs produced by this or other providers for the NameSpace of this instance. 
For DMTF-defined instances, the \"preferred\" algorithm must be used with the <OrgID> set to CIM."))

This class is included in the CIM database schema to provide explicit mapping to the way that the SNMP MIB defines database and service parameters. More information on the SNMP MIB parameters can be found in RFC 1697. 
The SNMP RDBMS MIB defines generic tables that contain rows of named database or service configuration entries. A parameter entry contains a parameter name, description, and value. See the description of the rdbmsDbParamTable or the rdbmsSrvParamTable for more detailed information on the SNMP definitions.")))
