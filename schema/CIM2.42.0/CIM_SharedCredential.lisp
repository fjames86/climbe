                  "Within the scope of the instantiating Namespace, InstanceID opaquely and uniquely identifies an instance of this class. In order to ensure uniqueness within the NameSpace, the value of InstanceID SHOULD be constructed using the following 'preferred' algorithm: 
<OrgID>:<LocalID> 
Where <OrgID> and <LocalID> are separated by a colon ':', and where <OrgID> MUST include a copyrighted, trademarked or otherwise unique name that is owned by the business entity creating/defining the InstanceID, or is a registered ID that is assigned to the business entity by a recognized global authority. (This is similar to the <Schema Name>_<Class Name> structure of Schema class names.) In addition, to ensure uniqueness, <OrgID> MUST NOT contain a colon (':'). When using this algorithm, the first colon to appear in InstanceID MUST appear between <OrgID> and <LocalID>. 
<LocalID> is chosen by the organizational entity and SHOULD not be re-used to identify different underlying (real-world) elements. If the above 'preferred' algorithm is not used, the defining entity MUST assure that the resultant InstanceID is not re-used across any InstanceIDs produced by this or other providers for this instance's NameSpace. 
For DMTF defined instances, the 'preferred' algorithm MUST be used with the <OrgID> set to 'CIM'."))

On CreateInstance, if this property is unspecified, or set to NULL, then a value of '99991231235959.999999+999' is assumed. Note that this property does not define how the expiration is set - but that there IS an expiration. The property may be set to either a specific date/time or an interval (calculated from the Issued datetime). For example, for Certificate Authority-signed public key, the expiration is determined by the CA. Another example is a voice mail password that expires 60 days after it is set/issued."))

Note that the Name property of ManagedSystemElement is also defined as a user-friendly name. But, it is often subclassed to be a Key. It is not reasonable that the same property can convey both identity and a user-friendly name, without inconsistencies. Where Name exists and is not a Key (such as for instances of LogicalDevice), the same information can be present in both the Name and ElementName properties. Note that if there is an associated instance of CIM_EnabledLogicalElementCapabilities, restrictions on this properties may exist as defined in ElementNameMask and MaxElementNameLen properties defined in that class."))

It is important to note that SharedCredential is not just a password, but rather is the password used with a particular security service.")))
