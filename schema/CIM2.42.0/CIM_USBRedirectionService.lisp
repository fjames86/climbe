The actual state of the element is represented by EnabledState. This property is provided to compare the last requested and current enabled or disabled states. Note that when EnabledState is set to 5 (\"Not Applicable\"), then this property has no meaning. Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. 
\"Unknown\" (0) indicates the last requested state for the element is unknown.
Note that the value \"No Change\" (5) has been deprecated in lieu of indicating the last requested state is \"Unknown\" (0). If the last requested or desired state is unknown, RequestedState should have the value \"Unknown\" (0), but may have the value \"No Change\" (5).Offline (6) indicates that the element has been requested to transition to the Enabled but Offline EnabledState. 
It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are \"Reboot\" (10) and \"Reset\" (11). Reboot refers to doing a \"Shut Down\" and then moving to an \"Enabled\" state. Reset indicates that the element is first \"Disabled\" and then \"Enabled\". The distinction between requesting \"Shut Down\" and \"Disabled\" should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. 

This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. 

If knowledge of the last RequestedState is not supported for the EnabledLogicalElement, the property shall be NULL or have the value 12 \"Not Applicable\".")

Various subclasses of this class may override this property to make it required, or a key. Such subclasses may also modify the preferred algorithms for ensuring uniqueness that are defined below.
To ensure uniqueness within the NameSpace, the value of InstanceID should be constructed using the following \"preferred\" algorithm: 
<OrgID>:<LocalID> 
Where <OrgID> and <LocalID> are separated by a colon (:), and where <OrgID> must include a copyrighted, trademarked, or otherwise unique name that is owned by the business entity that is creating or defining the InstanceID or that is a registered ID assigned to the business entity by a recognized global authority. (This requirement is similar to the <Schema Name>_<Class Name> structure of Schema class names.) In addition, to ensure uniqueness, <OrgID> must not contain a colon (:). When using this algorithm, the first colon to appear in InstanceID must appear between <OrgID> and <LocalID>. 
<LocalID> is chosen by the business entity and should not be reused to identify different underlying (real-world) elements. If not null and the above \"preferred\" algorithm is not used, the defining entity must assure that the resulting InstanceID is not reused across any InstanceIDs produced by this or other providers for the NameSpace of this instance.

\"Stressed\" indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of \"Stressed\" states are overload, overheated, and so on. 
\"Predictive Failure\" indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 
\"In Service\" describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered. 
\"No Contact\" indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 
\"Lost Communication\" indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 
\"Stopped\" and \"Aborted\" are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. 
\"Dormant\" indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. 
\"Supporting Entity in Error\" indicates that this element might be \"OK\" but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems. 
\"Completed\" indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). 
\"Power Mode\" indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association. 
\"Relocating\" indicates the element is being relocated.
OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element.")
