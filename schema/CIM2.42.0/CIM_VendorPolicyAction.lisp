Note that this property, and the analogous property SystemName, do not represent propagated keys from an instance of the class System. Instead, they are properties defined in the context of this class, which repeat the values from the instance of System to which this PolicyAction is related, either directly via the PolicyActionInPolicyRepository association or indirectly via the PolicyActionInPolicyRule aggregation.")

Various subclasses of this class may override this property to make it required, or a key. Such subclasses may also modify the preferred algorithms for ensuring uniqueness that are defined below.
To ensure uniqueness within the NameSpace, the value of InstanceID should be constructed using the following \"preferred\" algorithm: 
<OrgID>:<LocalID> 
Where <OrgID> and <LocalID> are separated by a colon (:), and where <OrgID> must include a copyrighted, trademarked, or otherwise unique name that is owned by the business entity that is creating or defining the InstanceID or that is a registered ID assigned to the business entity by a recognized global authority. (This requirement is similar to the <Schema Name>_<Class Name> structure of Schema class names.) In addition, to ensure uniqueness, <OrgID> must not contain a colon (:). When using this algorithm, the first colon to appear in InstanceID must appear between <OrgID> and <LocalID>. 
<LocalID> is chosen by the business entity and should not be reused to identify different underlying (real-world) elements. If not null and the above \"preferred\" algorithm is not used, the defining entity must assure that the resulting InstanceID is not reused across any InstanceIDs produced by this or other providers for the NameSpace of this instance. 
If not set to null for DMTF-defined instances, the \"preferred\" algorithm must be used with the <OrgID> set to CIM."))

It is not reasonable that the same property can convey both identity and a user-friendly name, without inconsistencies. Where Name exists and is not a Key (such as for instances of LogicalDevice), the same information can be present in both the Name and ElementName properties.

This MOF defines the following keywords: 'UNKNOWN', 'CONFIGURATION', 'USAGE', 'SECURITY', 'SERVICE', 'MOTIVATIONAL', 'INSTALLATION', and 'EVENT'. These concepts are self-explanatory and are further discussed in the SLA/Policy White Paper. One additional keyword is defined: 'POLICY'. The role of this keyword is to identify policy-related instances that may not be otherwise identifiable, in some implementations.
